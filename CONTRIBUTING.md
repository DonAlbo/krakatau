# How to Contribute

We'd love to accept your patches and contributions to this project. There are
just a few small guidelines you need to follow.

## Contributor License Agreement

Contributions to this project must be accompanied by a Contributor License
Agreement. You (or your employer) retain the copyright to your contribution;
this simply gives us permission to use and redistribute your contributions as
part of the project. Head over to <https://cla.developers.google.com/> to see
your current agreements on file or to sign a new one.

You generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you've already submitted one
(even if it was for a different project), you probably don't need to do it
again.

## Test suite

Please make sure that your contributions do not break any of the existing tests
and feel free to add new tests as you see fit to ensure your contributions are
not broken by future changes.

## Code reviews

Please submit your contributions by means of a GitHub pull request, as described
at [GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/).

A project member may review your patches for correctness and fitness with
project goals and objectives, and changes may be required before your
contributions are accepted into the project.

## Community Guidelines

This project follows
[Google's Open Source Community Guidelines](https://opensource.google.com/conduct/).
